# Stars! J-RC3 Parity Notes

## Population Growth

Status: DOCUMENTED / PARTIALLY MEASURED

### Confirmed behavior

For a planet with positive habitability:

- racial maximum growth rate is specified as a percentage per year;
- at 100% habitability, population may grow at the race's full growth rate;
- lower positive habitability scales the growth rate proportionally;
- growth begins to slow after the planet reaches 25% of its population capacity;
- population capacity is based on habitability.

For negative habitability:

- population dies each year;
- annual death percentage is `abs(habitability) / 10`.

### Measured behavior — uncrowded positive growth

#### PG-001 — growth carry

Ruleset: J-RC3

Scenario:

- ordinary race;
- 10% racial growth rate;
- 100% habitability;
- 1,000,000 population capacity;
- population below 25% capacity for the measured uncrowded interval.

Observed population, in units of 100 colonists:

| Year | Population |
|---:|---:|
| 2400 | 250 |
| 2401 | 275 |
| 2402 | 302 |
| 2403 | 332 |
| 2404 | 365 |
| 2405 | 402 |
| 2406 | 442 |
| 2407 | 486 |
| 2408 | 535 |
| 2409 | 588 |
| 2410 | 647 |
| 2411 | 712 |
| 2412 | 783 |
| 2413 | 861 |
| 2414 | 948 |
| 2415 | 1042 |
| 2416 | 1147 |
| 2417 | 1261 |
| 2418 | 1387 |
| 2419 | 1526 |
| 2420 | 1679 |
| 2421 | 1847 |
| 2422 | 2031 |
| 2423 | 2234 |
| 2424 | 2458 |
| 2425 | 2704 |

The complete uncrowded sequence above is reproduced exactly by carrying the
fractional remainder of growth forward between turns.

For the measured 100%-habitability, 10%-growth case, an equivalent integer
calculation is:

```go
numerator := populationHundreds*growthPercent + growthCarry
growthHundreds := numerator / 100
growthCarry = numerator % 100
populationHundreds += growthHundreds
```

For example:

```text
250 * 10 +  0 = 2500 -> +25, carry  0 -> 275
275 * 10 +  0 = 2750 -> +27, carry 50 -> 302
302 * 10 + 50 = 3070 -> +30, carry 70 -> 332
332 * 10 + 70 = 3390 -> +33, carry 90 -> 365
365 * 10 + 90 = 3740 -> +37, carry 40 -> 402
```

This explains the apparent rounding anomaly at `36,500 -> 40,200`: the
previous turns have accumulated a fractional growth remainder.

At `245,800 -> 270,400`, the accumulator returns to zero. This gives a clean
starting condition for measuring the post-25%-capacity crowding curve.

#### Binary confirmation from `.HST`

Eight consecutive PG-001 host files were decoded for years 2400-2407. The
planet record stores population in hundreds of colonists and contains a
separate one-byte field named `excessPop` by StarsAPI. The decoded values were:

| Year | Population units | Display population | `excessPop` | Carry predicted from prior turn |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 2400 | 250 | 25,000 | 0 | 0 |
| 2401 | 275 | 27,500 | 0 | 0 |
| 2402 | 302 | 30,200 | 50 | 50 |
| 2403 | 332 | 33,200 | 70 | 70 |
| 2404 | 365 | 36,500 | 90 | 90 |
| 2405 | 402 | 40,200 | 40 | 40 |
| 2406 | 442 | 44,200 | 60 | 60 |
| 2407 | 486 | 48,600 | 80 | 80 |

The stored `excessPop` value matches the independently inferred growth carry
for all eight snapshots. This is direct binary evidence that J-RC3 maintains a
separate persistent remainder associated with population growth, rather than
merely rounding each year's displayed population independently.

For this measured case, the on-disk state is therefore behaviorally equivalent
to:

```go
type PopulationState struct {
    Hundreds int
    Carry    int // stored as excessPop; observed range here 0..99
}
```

`excessPop` should not be interpreted as ordinary hidden colonists added to the
planet's displayed population. Its observed evolution matches a remainder from
the growth calculation.

Interpretation:

- population is stored in units of 100 colonists in the measured `.HST`
  records;
- simple per-turn rounding or truncation does **not** explain the sequence;
- a persistent fractional growth accumulator explains every measured
  uncrowded transition exactly;
- the `.HST` `excessPop` byte matches that inferred accumulator exactly across
  eight consecutive turns;
- the population/carry representation is therefore binary-confirmed for this
  uncrowded 100%-habitability, 10%-growth scenario.

Supporting observation: an earlier run under the registration/copy-protection
penalty, which halved effective growth to 5%, also matches the same carry model
exactly. After serial validation restored 10% growth, preserving the existing
carry predicts both observed transitions `35,100 -> 38,600 -> 42,500`. This
suggests that the carry persists when the effective growth rate changes, though
that behavior should be retested under a normal gameplay modifier before being
treated as a general rule.

### Maximum population

For an ordinary race on a 100% world:

    1,000,000

Known modifiers:

- Hyper-Expansion: 500,000
- Jack-of-All-Trades: 1,200,000
- Only Basic Remote Mining: +10% capacity

Positive worlds below 5% habitability are treated as 5% for
population-capacity purposes.

### Unknown / needs measurement

- Exact growth formula above 25% capacity. One point is measured
  (PG-002: 2704 → 2958 units at 27.04%); it rejects H0, H1 and H2 as
  stated, and identifies nothing.
- Exact handling of `excessPop` / growth carry when habitability or crowding
  introduces additional fractional modifiers.
- Whether growth carry persists across ordinary gameplay changes to effective
  growth rate.
- Exact order of operations between:
  - habitability modifier
  - racial growth rate
  - crowding modifier
  - growth carry / integer truncation
- Exact behavior at 100% capacity.
- Exact overcrowding death curve between 100% and 400%.
- Lifecycle of `excessPop` across migration, colonization, ownership changes,
  hostile-world deaths, and other population-changing mechanics.

### Measured behavior — PG-002, first crowded turn

Status: MEASURED (one turn, one planet, read from the UI). Run on
2026-10-06 with the cloud oracle (`docs/ORACLE.md`).

Question: what does one turn of growth do just above 25% capacity?

Starting state, observed: PG001 at 2425, Endeavor population 270,400
(27.04% of 1,000,000), read in the Stars! UI after advancing the registered
base from 2407 by 18 empty-order turns (`turn PG001.M1`, oracle restarted
between turns). The 2408 reading on this base was 53,500, matching PG-001.
The carry at 2425 is *inferred* to be 0 from the PG-001 carry model; it is
not binary-confirmed (Elegy does not decode `.HST` bodies).

Predictions, written before the run (10% growth, 100% habitability, carry 0,
factor applied to the uncrowded growth before truncation):

| Hypothesis | Factor at 27.04% | Predicted 2426 |
|---|---:|---:|
| H0: no slowdown yet (uncrowded rule continues) | 1.000 | 297,400 |
| H1: quadratic, 16/9 × (1 − x)² (recalled community formula; unverified) | 0.946 | 295,900 |
| H2: linear, (1 − x) / 0.75 | 0.973 | 296,700 |

Observation (UI, Endeavor Status panel and Summary, one run from the
`pg001-2425` snapshot):

| Year | Population | Units of 100 |
|---:|---:|---:|
| 2425 | 270,400 | 2704 |
| 2426 | **295,800** | 2958 |

Growth was 25,400 (254 units). The uncrowded rule would give 270.4 → 270.

Result:

- H0 is rejected: growth slowed in the first turn above 25% capacity.
- H1 and H2, as stated above, are both rejected. H2 misses by 900 colonists.
  H1 misses by 100 colonists (one unit): it predicts 255.89 → 255 units,
  the observation is 254.
- This is one data point. It does not identify a formula, and nothing has
  been tested about whether H1 with a different carry, rounding, or order
  of operations would fit. Those are open questions, not conclusions.

Context of the run, observed:

- Orders were empty (no production queue). The year's messages were the
  empty production queue and an Energy tech level 7 breakthrough with two
  benefits (Shadow Shield, Energy Capacitor). No other population-related
  message was shown.
- Mines and factories stayed at 10 operable; nothing was built.

Evidence: the `.HST` for every year 2407–2426 of this run, the recorder's
`observations.jsonl`, the UI screenshots and a SHA-256 manifest are in the
private `bfaber-centaur/stars-oracle-apparatus` repository, under
`evidence/pg002/`. They are kept out of this repository because the files were
produced by a registered copy and the repository is public. SHA-256:

| Year | `PG001.HST` SHA-256 | Header (turn / flags) |
|---:|---|---|
| 2425 | `e4bf2e0e38250769d6d394391d540fe2d4833a672428d077fa13bf5f2ddae0fc` | 25 / `0xa0` |
| 2426 | `150172b721c8e83676e125ce73bfecf318a9dde5410afd384fe569a2b8303201` | 26 / `0xa0` |

Limits: one turn, one planet, one run. The UI shows population in units of
100 and does not show the carry. The experiment assumes nothing besides
growth changed population.

- Cloud oracle re-measurement, 2026-10-06 (`docs/ORACLE.md`): PG001 2407 →
  2408 was generated twice (once by hand, once scripted), both times from
  the same snapshot taken after the serial was accepted. Endeavor's
  population, read in the Stars! UI, went 48,600 → 53,500 both times. That
  matches the 2408 value above, not the 51,100 predicted under the
  halved-growth penalty.

### Tests

Planned:

- unit fixture reproducing PG-001 exactly;
- binary fixture asserting the decoded PG-001 population / `excessPop` sequence;
- differential fixture for the clean 10% / 100%-habitability run;
- follow-up tests varying growth rate and habitability to determine how the
  accumulator interacts with other modifiers.
