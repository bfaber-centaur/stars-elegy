# Parity vectors

Machine-readable test cases taken from oracle runs of the original Stars!
J-RC3. Each file is one run: a starting position, the number of years the
original game generated from it, and what the original produced. An
implementation passes a case when it reaches the same observable values from
the same start.

Every value here is a behavior-level quantity (positions, cargo, tech levels,
design slots, who knows a wormhole). The files carry no game-file bytes,
serial numbers or screenshots. The rule each case tests is written up in the
spec document the vector cites; the vector is the evidence, not the rule.

`internal/vectors` holds the same format as Go types and a test that
decodes every file strictly, so `go test ./...` fails on a malformed vector.

## A vector

```jsonc
{
 "schema": "stars-elegy-vector/1",
 "id": "FM-101",
 "title": "...",
 "source": {"experiment": "experiments/fm2", "spec_rules": "docs/KERNEL.md \"Fleet movement\"",
            "parity": "docs/PARITY.md ...", "raw_evidence": "(private)"},
 "years": 1,                     // years generated from the start
 "random": "single_stream",      // or "several_streams" (below)
 "streams": 1,
 "initial_state": {...},
 "orders": [...],                // optional: orders the players submitted
 "cases": [...]
}
```

### `initial_state`

The whole position the run started from, read from the original's own start
file, so nothing in it is a default you have to guess.

- `game`: universe size and bounds, player count, and the game record's
  options (`random_events`, `slower_tech`, `public_scores`) and
  `victory_conditions` (each with its value in game units and, for the seven
  that can be switched, `enabled`), when the vector's builder read them.
- `players`: `computer: true` for a computer player (the host plans its
  orders each year; a vector lists only the outcomes its case is about),
  tech levels by field, research accumulated per field, research
  percent and field, `research_next_field` (the stored "next field to
  research" choice: a field, `same` or `lowest`; an explicit field is used
  at the next level-up in the current field and then reset to `same`,
  `docs/KERNEL.md` "Research"), relations to each other player (`neutral`, `friend`,
  `enemy`), Mystery Trader items owned, and the race: PRT, LRTs, growth rate,
  habitability (center, low, high per axis, 255 = immune), colonists per
  resource, factory and mine settings, research cost per field, the leftover
  points spend (`UNIVERSE.md` "Leftover advantage points") and race stat 15 (PARITY "Turn-time penalty"). An out-of-range PRT is given
  as its stored number.
- `planets`: position, owner (-1 none), mineral concentrations, environment
  (gravity, temperature, radiation as stored values), original environment,
  surface minerals (ironium, boranium, germanium), population **in hundreds**,
  mines, factories, defenses, planetary scanner, starbase (design slot and
  damage). Planets nobody owns may list only position, concentrations and
  environment.
- `designs`, `starbase_designs`: owner, design slot, hull name, then one entry
  per hull slot (`{"count", "part"}`, or `null` for an empty slot).
- `battle_plans`, `production_queues` (items `{id, count, percent, kind}`;
  `percent` is the part of the first unit already built, omitted when 0;
  `kind` and `id` name the item as in "Queue items" below).
- `fleets`: owner, id, position, the planet orbited, ships (`design` slot and
  `count`, with damage when damaged), cargo, fuel, battle plan,
  `repeat_orders` (present and true when the fleet repeats its waypoints),
  `name` (when the player named the fleet),
  and the waypoints. A
  waypoint has a position, warp, target (`planet`, `fleet`, `space`,
  `wormhole`, `trader`) and task. Waypoint 0 is where the fleet is now. Transport tasks list one order per cargo type:
  `load_all`, `unload_all`, `load_exactly`, `unload_exactly`,
  `fill_to_percent`, `wait_for_percent`,
  `load_optimal`, `set_amount_to`, `set_waypoint_to` with a value. A patrol
  task has its `range`; a lay-mines task its `years`; a transfer task its
  `to_player`.
- A planet with a route has `route_to`, the destination planet.
- `objects`: wormhole ends (partner, stability class, years since the last
  jump, players who know it, players who know where it leads), Mystery
  Traders (destination, warp, players met), mineral packets, minefields.

Without an `orders` block, the orders a case tests are the fleets'
waypoints and tasks and the other standing orders in this state; no other
orders were submitted for the generated years.

#### Queue items

A queue item's `kind` is 1 for a planetary item and 2 for a design. For
kind 2, `id` 0–15 is the owner's ship design slot and 16–25 is starbase
design slot `id − 16` (CONFIRMED: CL-TOOL built ship design 1 from
`1:2:2`; SL starbase replacements queued ids 16–18). For kind 1:

| id | item | evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Auto Mines (builds Mines) | CONFIRMED (PQ-001 C04, C09, C14) |
| 1 | Auto Factories (builds Factories) | CONFIRMED (PQ-001 C03, C09; KX-001 A3) |
| 2 | Auto Defenses (builds Defenses) | CONFIRMED (PQ-001 C13) |
| 3 | Auto Alchemy (builds Mineral Alchemy; also the alchemy prefix) | CONFIRMED (PQ-001 C05–C07; KX-001) |
| 4 | Auto Min Terraform (builds Terraform Environment) | CONFIRMED (KX-005) |
| 5 | Auto Max Terraform (builds Terraform Environment) | CONFIRMED (KX-005) |
| 6 | Auto Mineral Packets (builds Mixed Mineral Packets) | BINARY-ONLY |
| 7 | Factory | CONFIRMED (PQ-001) |
| 8 | Mine | CONFIRMED (PQ-001) |
| 9 | Defenses | CONFIRMED (PQ-001 C12) |
| 10 | unused (no cost, builds nothing) | BINARY-ONLY |
| 11 | Mineral Alchemy | CONFIRMED (KX-001 A1: the partial left in front of Auto Alchemy) |
| 12 | Terraform Environment | CONFIRMED (KX-005; `docs/KERNEL.md` "Terraforming") |
| 13 | Genesis Device | BINARY-ONLY |
| 14 | Ironium Mineral Packet | a packet order: CONFIRMED (KB-2A 12, OT-3); which mineral: BINARY-ONLY |
| 15 | Boranium Mineral Packet | BINARY-ONLY |
| 16 | Germanium Mineral Packet | BINARY-ONLY |
| 17 | Mixed Mineral Packet | BINARY-ONLY |
| 18–26 | one specific planetary scanner, in `docs/COMPONENTS.md` order (Viewer 50 first) | BINARY-ONLY |
| 27 | Planetary Scanner (the best one available when it completes) | a scanner order: CONFIRMED (KB-2A 9); which scanner: BINARY-ONLY |

Ids 0–6 are the auto items: their count is a yearly limit and they stay in
the queue (`docs/KERNEL.md` "Production").

### `orders`

The orders players submitted, one block per player and generated year, in
the order the player gave them (the original applied them in that order).
They are written in Elegy's terms: what each order asks for, not how the
original's order file stores it. Fleets, planets, designs and plans named in
an order belong to the submitting player unless a field says otherwise.

```jsonc
"orders": [
 {"year": 1, "player": 0, "orders": [
  {"kind": "cargo", "fleet": 2, "with": {"kind": "planet", "id": 17},
   "amounts": {"ironium": 15, "germanium": -5}},
  {"kind": "fleet_battle_plan", "fleet": 0, "plan": 3}
 ]}
]
```

| kind | fields |
|---|---|
| `production_queue` | `planet`, `items` (`{id, count, percent, kind}` as in `production_queues`): the planet's whole new queue |
| `planet_settings` | `planet`, `leftover_to_research`, `route_to` |
| `research` | `percent`, `field`, `next_field` (a field, `same`, `lowest`, or the stored number) |
| `battle_plan` | `slot`, `name`, `tactic`, `primary`, `secondary`, `attack_who`, `dump_cargo`: add the plan at `slot` or change it |
| `battle_plan_delete` | `slot` |
| `fleet_battle_plan` | `fleet`, `plan` |
| `design` | `starbase`, `slot`, `hull`, `slots` (as in `designs`): add or change |
| `design_delete` | `starbase`, `slot` |
| `waypoint_add`, `waypoint_change` | `fleet`, `index`, `waypoint` (as in `fleets`) |
| `waypoint_delete` | `fleet`, `index` |
| `repeat_orders` | `fleet`, `on` |
| `cargo` | `fleet`, `with` (`{kind: planet or fleet, id, owner}`), `amounts` per cargo type (kT; colonists in hundreds; fuel in mg), positive into the fleet and negative out of it |
| `split` | `fleet`: a new empty fleet beside it, which the next `move_ships` fills |
| `move_ships` | `fleet`, `with` (`{kind: fleet, owner, id}`), `ships` (`{design, count}`), counts positive into `fleet` and negative out of it |
| `merge` | `fleet`, `fleets` that join it |
| `rename` | `fleet`, `name` |
| `detonate` | `minefield`, `on` |
| `relations` | `relations` (player → `neutral`, `friend`, `enemy`) |

The client-order corpora so far use `cargo` (to planets and own fleets),
`split`, `move_ships`, `merge`, `rename`, `production_queue`, `research`, `battle_plan`, `battle_plan_delete`,
`fleet_battle_plan`, `design`, `design_delete` and `waypoint_change`. The
other kinds are defined for the rest of `ORDERS.md` and have no vector yet.
Order vectors' `fleet` expectations also list the fleet's `waypoints`,
`battle_plan`, `repeat_orders` and `name` (when the player named the
fleet).

### `cases`

```jsonc
{
 "id": "FM-101-A",
 "rule": "KERNEL IFE",             // the rule label the experiment used
 "setup": "QJ5 scout, warp 6, +100 x, 300 mg: ...",
 "tag": "CONFIRMED",
 "prediction_held": true,
 "varies_by_stream": false,
 "expect": [
  {"year": 1, "kind": "fleet", "owner": 0, "id": 0,
   "equals": {"x": 1041, "y": 1005, "fuel": 295, "next_waypoint_warp": 6}}
 ]
}
```

`expect` lists what the original produced, observed after `year` generated
years. Check only the fields listed; everything else in the game is
unconstrained by that case.

| kind | subject | `equals` fields |
|---|---|---|
| `fleet` | fleet `owner`/`id` | `x`, `y`, `fuel`, `cargo`, `ships`, `damage`, `next_waypoint_warp`, `first_waypoint_task` |
| `fleet_gone` | fleet `owner`/`id` no longer exists | |
| `fleet_at` | a fleet of `owner` at (`x`, `y`) | as `fleet` |
| `no_fleet_at` | no fleet of `owner` at (`x`, `y`) | |
| `no_new_fleets` | `owner` gained no fleet | |
| `planet` | planet `id` | `owner`, `population` (hundreds), `surface_minerals`, `environment`, `original_environment`, `defenses`, `starbase_design`, ... |
| `production_queue` | planet `planet` | the queue as `{id, count, percent, kind}` items (`percent` omitted when 0; `kind` 1 planetary item, 2 design, as in "Queue items") |
| `design`, `starbase_design` | design `owner`/`slot` | `hull`, `slots`, `mass` |
| `design_gone`, `starbase_design_gone` | design `owner`/`slot` no longer exists | |
| `battle_plan` | plan `owner`/`slot` | `name`, `tactic`, `primary`, `secondary`, `attack_who`, `dump_cargo` |
| `battle_plan_gone` | plan `owner`/`slot` no longer exists | |
| `player` | player `id` | `tech`, `research_accumulated`, `research_percent`, `research_field`, `relations`, `counts`, `mystery_trader_items`, `ship_design_count`, `score_record` (score, resources, planets, starbases, unarmed/escort/capital ship counts, tech level sum, rank, `victory_conditions_met`; `seen_by` names the player whose file held it) |
| `wormhole` | wormhole end `id` | `known_to`, `destination_known_to` |
| `trader` | Mystery Trader `id` | `x`, `y`, `warp`, `destination`, `met` |
| `packet` | packet `owner`/`id` | `x`, `y` (within `tolerance` ly) |

`tolerance` as an object (`{"surface_minerals": 1}`) allows that much
difference in the named field. Kernel and combat vectors use it for surface
minerals, because mining's +1 remainder is random (`KERNEL.md`). Combat
vectors give it only to planets where a mining draw can happen that year:
owned with mines at the start of the year, or orbited by a remote miner.
Minerals from battle debris stay exact.

`sample: true` marks an expectation that random draws decided and that only
one stream observed. It is what the original did with that stream's draws,
not a fixed result: compare it exactly only when you replay the same draws,
and otherwise treat it as one sample of what the rule allows. Single-stream
combat vectors flag what the year's battle draws decide (see "Combat
vectors").

| `salvage_at` | salvage at (`x`, `y`) | `minerals`; `observed: "none"` if there was none |
| `message` | player `player` got message `message_id` | `present` |
| `object` | a new or changed map object | the object, as in `initial_state.objects` |
| `object_gone` | the object `subject` (`{kind, owner, id}`) no longer exists, e.g. a swept minefield | |
| `minefield` | minefield `owner`/`id` | `x`, `y`, `mines`, `type`, `detonating`; `radius` when the case checks it |
| `view` | what player `viewer` knows of `subject` (`{kind, owner, id}`: a planet, fleet, wormhole, minefield, design or player) | the fields the case checks, e.g. `level` (report level), `known`, `starbase_visible`, `heading`, `design_count` |
| `battle` | the battle at (`x`, `y`) | `players`, `planet`, and `tokens`: per token its `owner`, `fleet` or `planet`, `kind`, `design`, `start_square`, `initiative`, `mass`, `shield`, `jammer`, `computer`, `capacitor`, `deflector`, `ships`, `damage` |
| `battle_actions` | the moves and shots of that battle | `actions`: per action `round`, `token`, `to` (square, or `null` for leaving the board) and `hits` (`token`, `flags`, `kills`, `shield_damage`, `armor_damage`) |
| `no_battle` | no battle record was written | |
| `client_estimate` | a value the original client shows on `screen` for `subject` after the year | `field` names the value; `equals` holds it as a number or a short value with its unit, never the client's sentence |
| `sample` | a random outcome | see below |

### Tags

- `CONFIRMED`: the original matched a prediction made in advance from the
  spec rule. If the case also `varies_by_stream`, the rule held in every
  stream and the values are each stream's exact outcome.
- `MEASURED`: the value is what the original did, but either the
  prediction missed (the cited PARITY section says what the miss showed) or
  the outcome is random. The observed value is still the original's behavior.
- `LEGACY BUG`: the original's behavior here is a defect that the spec
  documents. Elegy's default is to reproduce such behavior behind a named
  switch; see the cited spec.

`prediction_held` is kept separately so you can see which cases changed the
spec. The order corpora (`xf`, `bp`, `tk5`, `wu`) each ran once, in one
pinned random stream, so their cases are `MEASURED` even where the
prediction held; `prediction_held` is false where no prediction was
committed before the run, and `verdict` says which.

### Randomness

The original seeds its random numbers from the clock, so a run cannot give
you the original's random stream. Vectors handle this two ways:

- `random: "several_streams"`: the same start was run under several seeds.
  An expectation that came out the same in every stream is listed once; one
  that differed is listed once per stream with a `stream` label, and the case
  has `varies_by_stream: true`. Treat those as samples of a distribution.
- `kind: "sample"`: the case tests a random outcome. `observed` is what the
  original produced (per stream when there are several) and `constraint` says
  what the rule allows, as a short description or the bounds the experiment
  checked. Check that your result satisfies the constraint and, over many
  seeds, that the observed values look typical.

A case with `void_streams` lists streams where its setup was spoiled by an
unrelated random event (a Mystery Trader changing speed before the staged
meeting); those streams are left out of `expect`.

### Combat vectors

The combat rounds have no per-case checker output, so a `cb` vector has one
case per experiment setup and its expectations are the whole observed turn:
every battle record, decoded, and every fleet, planet, player, queue and
salvage change in the host file. The setup's predictions are in
`experiments/cbNNN/README.md`; `verdict` summarizes how they fared and the
tag follows it. Rounds from CB-009 on ran under pinned random streams, so the
same start gave the same record within a stream; CB-001..008 were not
pinned. A battle's token list is often identical in every stream while its
actions differ, which is why `battle` and `battle_actions` are separate.

Every battle draws (movement ties, each round's jitter, torpedo hits:
`docs/COMBAT.md` "Random draws in a battle"). In a single-stream `cb`
vector these expectations carry `sample: true`: `battle_actions`, the
`fleet` and `fleet_gone` of every fleet that fought, `salvage_at` a battle's
position, and a battle planet's `starbase`, `defenses` and
`surface_minerals` (split from the planet's other fields, which stay exact).
The `battle` token lists and everything away from the battles stay exact,
apart from the mining tolerance above. In a several-stream `cb` vector the
`fleet` and `fleet_gone` of every fleet that fought carry `sample: true` as
well: which fleets die in a battle, and how hurt the survivors are, depends
on the draws even where the few streams run agreed (CB-036, CB-039,
CB-042..044 list hundreds of destroyed fleets).

A `sample` battle record is still an exact check of the damage rules. Given
the recorded moves and shots, every hit is deterministic: replay the
actions in order, each shot from the recorded token at the recorded target
(as the exact replays in `docs/COMBAT.md` "Choosing a square" do, with the
shots taken from the record),
and every hit's `kills`, `shield_damage` and `armor_damage`, and the
shields carried between rounds, must come out exactly as recorded. CB-007
and CB-008 (Regenerating Shields), CB-010 (Q-7, leftover beam damage) and
CB-016 (Q-3, the station firing) check their CONFIRMED rules this way, and
their `verdict` says so. In a several-stream vector, what
differed between streams is listed per stream as usual.

Minefields and stargates draw too. In the `mf` runs where fleets cross a
field at a speed with a stop chance (MF-01, 02, 03h, 03s, 04, 04b, 04d,
05b, 09h, 09s, 14, 15), the `fleet` and `fleet_gone` of every fleet that
moved and every `salvage_at` carry `sample: true`, in every stream: where a
fleet stops decides its position, fuel, cargo and damage. In the
single-stream ones the `minefield` expectations do too, since every stop
is paid by a field (MF-4). In `gt`, the fleets whose survivors a gate's
loss roll decided (a predicted ship range, the O-65 fleets of which only
some arrive, the GT-003 W cases) carry `sample: true`, and so do message
ids that only some of those fleets got. In `ob`, a PP terraforming step's
size is a draw, so OB-029's `environment` expectations are samples.

### New-game vectors

A universe-generation vector has `new_game` (`settings` and `races`) in place
of `initial_state` and `years: 0`; its expectations (`year: 0`) describe the
generated starting game. Values that only the original's random stream
decides, such as planet positions, appear as samples or counts, not as exact
expectations.

### Not vectors

Static part data (CS-001, CS-002 readouts) is in `data/components.json`,
which is already machine-readable, so it has no vectors.

## Building

`tools/vectors/build.py` regenerates a corpus from the private raw evidence
(start files and check output in `stars-oracle-apparatus`). It writes only the
decoded quantities above. Implementers never need to run it.

```sh
